```

## Best Practices

- **Start with data**: Don't rely on assumptions about the problem
- **Involve stakeholders**: Get input from those affected by the problem
- **Think systemically**: Consider the broader context and interconnections
- **Test solutions**: Pilot before full implementation
- **Measure everything**: Use metrics to validate success
